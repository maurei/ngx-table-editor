causes the table editor to exit upon a click outside of the table.\nThe implementation\nimport { NavigationAction, AbstractNavigator } from 'ngx-table-editor'\n\nclass MouseNavigator extends AbstractNavigator {\n    public listener(): () => void {\n        const unregisterFn = this.renderer.listen(document, 'click', this.actionGenerator.bind(this));\n        return unregisterFn\n    }\n    private actionGenerator(event: MouseEvent): void {\n        if (!(event as any).path.includes(this.tableElementRef.nativeElement)) {\n            this.execute(NavigationAction.Exit);\n        }\n    }\n}Any class that inherits from AbstractNavigator must implement a listener method, in which any interaction with the DOM is done (listening to scrolling events):\n    public listener(): () => void {\n        // attach the appropiate listener to the dom.\n        const unregisterFn = this.renderer.listen(document, 'click', this.actionGenerator.bind(this));\n        // make sure to return the unregisterFn. It is called internally when the table is destroyed.\n        return unregisterFn;\n    }Internally, the navigator will be injected in the TableEditorDirective constructor, and the listener method will be called by the instance of TableEditorDirective as soon as angular fires the OnInit lifecycle hook. It must return a unregister function which will be fired when the TableEditorDirective is destroyed.\n    private actionGenerator(event: MouseEvent): void {\n        // Through the inheritance of `AbstractNavigator`, instances of the MouseNavigator class have access to the `ElementRef` of the table, through `this.tableElementRef`.\n        if (!(event as any).path.includes(this.tableElementRef.nativeElement)) {\n            this.execute(NavigationAction.Exit);\n        }\n    }Lastly, the navigator must be added to the TE_NAVIGATORS multi provider, which is done by registering it in the providers section in your module as follows:\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { TE_NAVIGATORS } from 'ngx-table-editor'\nimport { MouseNavigator } from './mouse-navigator'\n\n@NgModule({\n    providers: [\n        { provide: TE_NAVIGATORS, useValue: MouseNavigator, multi: true },\n    ]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}Notes\n\nInjection in the navigators is currently not possible because the navigators are instantiated by TableEditorDirective, not through Angular DI. This should probably be changed in a later version.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { ElementRef, Renderer2, InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';\n\nexport const TE_NAVIGATORS = new InjectionToken('TeNavigators');\n\n/**\n * An enumerator that reflect the possible movements that happen within a table.\n */\nexport enum NavigationAction {\n\tUp = 'up',\n\tRight = 'right',\n\tDown = 'down',\n\tLeft = 'left',\n\tExit = 'exit'\n}\n/**\n * An abstract base class that can be used to implement a navigator, allowing for interactions between the UI and [TableEditorDirective]{@link TableEditorDirective}.
